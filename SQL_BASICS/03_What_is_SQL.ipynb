    "\n",
    "SQL statements resemble English sentences, complete with “noise words” that don’t add to the meaning of the statement but make it read more naturally. SQL has quite a few inconsistencies and also some special rules to prevent you from constructing SQL statements that look perfectly legal but that don’t make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the inaccuracy of its name, SQL has emerged as the standard language for using relational databases. SQL is both a powerful language and one that is relatively easy to learn. So, SQL is a database management language. The database administrator is answerable for handling a minicomputer or mainframe database and makes use of SQL to outline the database shape and manipulate get entry to the saved data."
