The data in common databases is modeled in tables, making querying and processing efficient. Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing.\n",

    "A database is a collection of data that is organized, which is also called structured data. It can be accessed or stored in a computer system. It can be managed through a Database Management System (DBMS), a software used to manage data. Database refers to related data in a structured form.\n",

We encounter several activities that involve our interaction with databases, for example in the bank, in the railway station, in school, in a grocery store, etc. These are the instances where we need to store a large amount of data in one place and fetch these data easily.
